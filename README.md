## How to run the code?

In our scripts, we provide two ways to run it:

## 1) JupyterLab: 

To run the script, simply execute the <span style="color: red;"><ins>GBert_cora_full_procedure.ipynb</ins><span> notebook. This script works independently, without requiring any external file support.

## 2) Python:

To run a script, 

```bash
python3 main_py.py
